In this exciting project, we tackle the challenge of dog breed identification using deep learning techniques. With a growing interest in fine-grained image categorization.

## Project Goal:

The primary objective is to create a robust classifier that can accurately identify the breed of a dog from a given image. The dataset used in this project includes images from 120 different dog breeds, each with a unique set of characteristics. The challenge lies in distinguishing between these breeds, especially when the differences are subtle, making it a "ruff" problem indeed!

## Dataset Description:

The dataset is a canine subset of the well-known ImageNet, consisting of both training and test sets of dog images. Each image is labeled with its corresponding breed, serving as the target for the classifier. The task requires leveraging the limited number of training images per breed to build a model capable of generalizing well to unseen data.

## Why This Project?

This project is an excellent way to deepen your understanding of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and fine-tune your approach to image classification tasks. By working on this project, you'll gain hands-on experience in dealing with class imbalances, optimizing models, and improving accuracy in a real-world image recognition problem.
